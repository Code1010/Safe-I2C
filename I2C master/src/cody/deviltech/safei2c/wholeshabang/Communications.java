/*

    Handles actual communications. Communications should only happen
        if there are no current transactions. It can be assumed that this
        class will not be activated before a transaction is over

    This class depends on the device classes (Gyro, Accelerometer, and compass)
        Make sure you have all of them! So save hastle, just grab the whole
        package
